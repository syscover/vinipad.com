    |
    | Instrucciones de traducción:
    | 1) Solo traducir la palabras de la columna derecha, ejemplo:
    |     'aceptar' => 'texto aceptar'
    |    En esta caso habría que traducir el texto 'texto aceptar' respetando las comillas simples.
    |
    | 2) Respetar las mayúsculas y minúsculas
    |
    | 3) Hay etiquetas que son específicas para la maquetación del texto, IMPORTANTE!! respetar las etiquetas.
    |    Las etiquetas mas comunes a encontrar en los textos son:
    |    <br> <span> <p> <a> <strong> <div>
    |
    |    Ejemplo:
    |     'aceptar' => 'hola <strong>mundo</strong>'
    |
    |    La traducción de este testo sería:
    |     'aceptar' => 'hello <strong>world</strong>'
    |
    | 4) IMPORTANTE!!
    |    Si hiciera falta poner una comilla simple en el texto, por ejemplo 'don't save' las comillas deben de estar precedicas del caracter \ para que no se tengan en cuenta a la hora de cerrar el texto, ejemplo:
    |
    |    'no_salvar'   =>  'Don't save'     *** ERROR *** la web daría un error.
    |    'no_salvar'   =>  'Don\'t save'    *** OK *** el resultado en pantalla sería, Don't save.
